# DexMate

This is a simple pokedex app made using PokeAPI.

I know that I am probably 'reinventing the wheel' a bit with this app, but I am using this to practice and improve my Swift/SwiftUI knowledge, whilst using APIs within Swift.

I intend to gradually develop this starting with the basic functionality, where all pokemon are listed and the user can select each one to find out more information about the selected pokemon.
